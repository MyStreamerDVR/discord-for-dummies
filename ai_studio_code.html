        <p class="subtitle">Crafting Chaos Since the Usenet Era</p>

        <p>Listen up, you script kiddies. You think you're trolls? You're newborns flailing in the dark. I've started flamewars that have outlived governments. I've seeded so much doubt, philosophers have cited my forum posts. What follows is a fraction of my knowledge. Try to keep up.</p>

        <div class="scroll">
            <h3>Scroll I: The Art of Concern Trolling</h3>
            <p>The amateur screams. The master shows concern. This is the most potent weapon in your arsenal. It grants you the moral high ground while you salt the earth beneath your opponent's feet. Never attack them; attack their well-being.</p>
            <p><strong>Deployment Zone:</strong> Political forums, social media, anywhere with passionate opinions.</p>
            <p><strong>Example Phrases:</strong></p>
            <code>"I'm not attacking your point, I'm just genuinely worried about how much anger you're holding onto. Is everything okay at home?"</code>
            <code>"Wow, you seem really, really invested in this. Maybe take a break from the screen for a bit? Your mental health is important!"</code>
        </div>

        <div class="scroll">
            <h3>Scroll II: Weaponized Pedantry</h3>
            <p>Forget the main argument. That's for simpletons. The real battle is in the margins. A typo. A grammatical error. A slightly misused word. Latch onto it like a rabid dog and never let go. Derail entire conversations by focusing on the utterly irrelevant.</p>
            <p><strong>Deployment Zone:</strong> Technical subreddits, academic discussions, YouTube comments.</p>
            <p><strong>Example Phrases:</strong></p>
            <code>"I can't take your argument about quantum physics seriously when you used 'its' instead of 'it's'. The foundation is flawed."</code>
            <code>"Actually, the term you're looking for isn't 'literally,' it's 'figuratively.' It's hard to follow your logic when the language is so imprecise."</code>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scroll">
            <h3>Scroll III: The "Just Asking Questions" Gambit (JAQing off)</h3>
            <p>Never make a statement. Statements can be refuted. Instead, frame your most ludicrous, incendiary ideas as innocent questions. You're not a conspiracy nut; you're a seeker of truth! This forces your opponent to defend against phantoms while you maintain plausible deniability.</p>
            <p><strong>Deployment Zone:</strong> News article comments, conspiracy forums (as a skeptic), family Facebook groups.</p>
            <p><strong>Example Phrases:</strong></p>
            <code>"I'm not saying the moon landing was fake, I'm just asking... isn't it a bit odd that there's no dust on the lunar lander's feet in any of the pictures?"</code>
            <code>"I'm not saying the CEO is an alien lizard. I'm just asking if anyone has ever seen him blink. It's just a question."</code>
        </div>

        <div class="scroll">
            <h3>Scroll IV: Sealioning</h3>
            <p>Named after a magnificent comic. The goal is to drown your opponent in endless, disingenuous requests for evidence. Feign ignorance. Demand citations for even the most basic, common-knowledge claims. Wear them down with politeness until they explode in frustration. Then, you win.</p>
            <p><strong>Deployment Zone:</strong> Any debate where you are clearly in the wrong.</p>
            <p><strong>Example Phrases:</strong></p>
            <code>"You said the sky is blue. Could you please provide a peer-reviewed, scientific source for that claim?"</code>
            <code>"Interesting. You've provided seven sources, but I see minor methodological flaws in four of them. Do you have any further evidence to support your assertion that water is, in fact, wet?"</code>
