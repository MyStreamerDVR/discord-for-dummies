        </header>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">You think trolling is a game? That's cute. This is psychological warfare. We don't poke, we vivisect. We don't argue, we dismantle. Your objective is to hollow out their conviction until all that's left is a husk of self-doubt. Now listen up and learn how to be a real monster.</p>

        <div class="grid">
            <!-- Existing Levels 1-4 -->
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Level 1: The Gaslight Guardian</h3>
                <p>Never attack their logic. Attack their sanity. Frame their passion as pathology. This makes them defend their own emotional state, a battle they can never win.</p>
                <div class="example">// Victim: "This new law is a disaster!"
// You: "Whoa, take a breath. The sheer vitriol in your post is... concerning. Are you doing okay? This level of emotional investment can't be healthy."</div>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Level 2: The Semantic Executioner</h3>
                <p>The argument itself is irrelevant. Find a single misplaced word. Latch onto it. Inflate it. Bleed them out on a comma splice. It's about making them feel stupid.</p>
                <div class="example">// Victim: "Your literally destroying the community!"
// You: "'Your'? Or 'You're'? The fact you can't distinguish between a possessive and a contraction nullifies any point you were attempting to make."</div>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Level 3: The 'Curiosity' Cobra</h3>
                <p>Inject pure poison wrapped in a question mark. Never assert your own insane conspiracy; make *them* disprove it. You're not an accuser; you're a humble seeker of truth.</p>
                <div class="example">// Victim: "This company's new product is great!"
// You: "I'm not making any accusations, just asking—is it normal for a CEO to sell 90% of his stock a week before a 'great' product launch?"</div>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Level 4: The DoS Attack (On Willpower)</h3>
                <p>Become a relentless, polite, logic-bot demanding impossible standards of proof for self-evident truths. The goal is complete, soul-crushing exhaustion.</p>
                <div class="example">// Victim: "This game is full of bugs."
// You: "Fascinating. Can you please provide the tracker link and reproducible steps for at least five of the most critical bugs? I require data, not anecdotes."</div>
            </div>

            <!-- NEW LEVELS -->
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Level 5: The Poisoned Echo</h3>
                <p>Do not fight them. Join them. Enthusiastically agree, then amplify their position to a grotesque, absurd extreme. This makes their own idea look moronic and forces them to argue against themselves.</p>
                <div class="example">// Victim: "I think we should have more online moderation."
// You: "I completely agree! In fact, all posts should be pre-approved by a committee and every user's identity verified with a passport. Anything less is just asking for chaos!"</div>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Level 6: The In-Group Inquisitor</h3>
                <p>The ultimate psychological attack. Don't attack them as an outsider; attack them as a member of their own tribe. Question their purity, their credentials, their dedication. Cast them out from their own "in-group" for being a pretender.</p>
                <div class="example">// Victim (Hardcore Fan): "This new episode was amazing!"
// You: "A casual viewer might think so. But someone who's read the original source material would spot the glaring plot holes. Did you even notice the continuity error with the main character's backstory?"</div>
